[Memory Usage]
1024 B EEPROM:
	500 x 2B unique IDs
	24 B other stuff

[Plan]
Broadcast own ID at regular intervals.
When detected other ID within a certain range, increment counter by 1.
Some IDs are static (camp pylons).

[Modules]
EEPROM I/O
RF24


[State Machine]
State 0: NORMAL
	LED1 = 'red'
	-Broadcasts own ID at regular intervals.
	-When detected other ID within a certain range, increment counter for that
		memory space by 1.
	Interrupts:
		IRQ 0: RTC/sysclock
		IRQ 1: StateTransition (SW1) 
		IRQ 2: RF24
	

State 1: ID-RECEIVING
	LED1 = 'yellow'
	while self.nameState == False:
		broadcast(MAC)
		self.ID = listenForIdGivingPacket(stuff)

	self.nameState = True
	stateTransition(0)

State 2: IDENTITY-GIVING
	LED1 = 'red'
	self.queue( listenForMacBroadcast() )
	for mac in queue:
		broadcastIdPacket(idCounter)
		idCounter++

State 3: DUMP_CORE
	LED1 = 'blue'
	-Dumps EEPROM contents to PC.
	-Broadcasts EEPROM contents across WiFi.
